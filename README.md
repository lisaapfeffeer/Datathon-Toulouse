# Datathon-Toulouse

At the Datathon in Toulouse, we were given a home credit default risk problem. As a data scientist team from Prêt à Dépenser, we were asked to develop a credit scoring tool that decides whether a customer gets a loan or not. 
Home credit risk means the risk that someone who gets a loan will not be able to repay it and is therefore of high importance to Prêt à Dépenser. 
Since Prêt à Dépenser’s business idea is based on giving loans to people with little or no loan history, other factors must be used to decide this. 
The model to be built should therefore be as accurate as possible to avoid heavy financial burdens.
